# Flux Workspace 🚀

### Why I created Flux
Flux is a workspace software designed to allow users to take notes, view related documents, brainstorm, and do many other things.

I created this application because I was tired of jumping between different apps every time I wanted to study or work on a project. I wanted a single, unified place where I could scribble on an infinite whiteboard, read and highlight PDFs, write structured notes in Markdown, and insert complex math formulas without any friction.

Flux is my ideal digital workspace: it’s simple, fast, and designed to stay out of your way.

### How it was built ("Vibe Coding")
This project is mainly **"vibe coded"** in order to deliver it quickly and not lose any time. I used AI to turn my ideas into code almost at the speed of thought, focusing on the experience and functionality rather than manually writing every single line from scratch.

However, **I personally stepped in (and I still do) to fix and refine several sections of the software** to ensure everything works exactly how I want it to.

### What you can do with Flux
*   **Infinite Whiteboard:** Write, draw, and organize elements anywhere in an endless space with smooth zooming and panning.
*   **PDF Tools:** Drag and drop a PDF into your board, read through it, and use the highlighter to take notes directly on the pages.
*   **Math & Notes:** I integrated LaTeX support for beautiful equations and Markdown for your structured text notes.
*   **Library Management:** You can manage multiple boards within the same project and download everything as a single `.zip` file so your work is always safe.

### Getting Started (Quick Guide)
Using Flux is meant to be intuitive. Here’s how to get up and running:

*   **Moving Around:** Use the **Pan tool (2)** or hold the **Spacebar** while dragging to move across the infinite canvas. Scroll or pinch to zoom in and out.
*   **Using Tools:** You can click the bottom toolbar or use these quick keyboard shortcuts:
    *   `1` for Select, `2` for Pan, `3` for Pen.
    *   `T` for Text, `E` for Equations (LaTeX), `S` for Shapes, `L` for Lines, and `I` for Images.
*   **Editing:** To change a note or a formula, just **double-click** it. Once you're done, press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to save and close the editor.
*   **Working with PDFs:** When you add a PDF, a preview card appears. Click the **"Preview"** button on the card to open the full reader, where you can flip through pages and highlight important sections.
*   **Saving your work:** Since Flux respects your privacy and doesn't use a cloud database, your work lives in your browser. To keep it safe forever, click the **Save icon** (or press `Cmd/Ctrl + S`) to download your entire project as a `.zip` file. You can reopen this file anytime later to pick up right where you left off.

### A PWA ready for any device
Flux is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**. This means:
1.  **It works offline:** Once you load it the first time, you can use it without an internet connection—perfect for traveling or working in spots with bad Wi-Fi.
2.  **It’s installable:** You can add it to your home screen on your phone, tablet, or desktop. It will behave just like a regular app, without the browser address bar.
3.  **Privacy first:** Your data stays in your browser and in the files you choose to save.

### The Tech behind it
*   **Vanilla JS:** No heavy frameworks—just pure JavaScript for maximum speed.
*   **Canvas API:** To power the infinite whiteboard.
*   **Key Libraries:** `pdf.js` for documents, `KaTeX` for math, and `marked.js` for Markdown.
